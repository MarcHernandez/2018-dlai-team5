# STYLE TRANSFER - DLAI TEAM #5

## Goals:
- Emulate the Style Transfer project
- Understand
- Modify some hyperparameters (?)

## What is Style Transfer?
Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style — and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style image.

## NN Structure

 In the image-wise NN, convolutional layers and maxpooling are typically used. Usually, pre-trained networks with large datasets --such as VGG16 & VGG19-- are used. These networks are useful since they have been trained to extract features of the input images.
